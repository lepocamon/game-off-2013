## Open-source frameworks & technologies involved

* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Morphtocat is written 100% on CoffeeScript
* [pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) - Super fast HTML 5 2D rendering engine that uses webGL with canvas fallback
* [Buzz](https://github.com/jaysalvat/buzz) - HTML5 audio element made easy, it also degrades silently on non-modern browsers

## And also thanks to...

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - For providing us a fast and responsive development environment
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - For managing our packages (pixi and a few more)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - For the initial scaffolding of the webapp
