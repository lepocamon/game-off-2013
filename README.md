## Morphtocat!

Play as the classic Octocat, the ultimate jumper Rainbowcat or the super-runner Dojocat and try to avoid the balls. Each cat has its own skills, so you're gonna need to morph from time to time.

## Open-source frameworks & technologies involved

* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - Morphtocat is written 100% on CoffeeScript
* [pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) - Super fast HTML 5 2D rendering engine that uses webGL with canvas fallback
* [Buzz](https://github.com/jaysalvat/buzz) - HTML5 audio element made easy, it also degrades silently on non-modern browsers

## And also thanks to...

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - For providing us a fast and responsive development environment
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - For managing our packages (pixi and a few more)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) - For the initial scaffolding of the webapp
* [@leereilly](https://github.com/leereilly) - For allowing us to use the octocats :)
